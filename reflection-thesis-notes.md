# Prologue

- Reasoning about reasoning is necessary but not sufficient for a process to be
  reflective.
- p15 : "roughly linguistic sort"
- Representation Hypothesis: Any mechanically embodied intelligent process will
  be comprised of structural ingredients that
  a) we as external observers naturally take to represent a
  propositional account of the knowledge that the overall process exhibits,
  and
  b) independent of such external semantical attribution, play a formal
  but causal and essential role in engendering the behaviour that manifests
  that knowledge.
  a) proposition = meaning of a declarative sentence, meaning = 
  b) emphasizing the syntactic nature of the process
- Reflection hypothesis: in as much as a computational procss can be constructed
  to reason about an external world in virtue of comprising an ingredient
  process (interpreter) formally manipulating representations of the world, so
  too a computational process could be made to reason about itself in virtue of
  comprising an ingredient process (interpreter) formally manipulating
  representations of its own operations and structures.
- Knowing is representational : what is he rambling about on p16? Is he saying
  KPR is true?
- p16 it is considered insufficient merely to propose true theories that do not
  enable some causally effective mechanical embodiment. Is he talking about
  implementability of algorithms using representations?
- p18 what is representation as an activity? What is a "representational" system
- Inflexibility about reasoning world => representation hypothesis
  Inflexibility about reasoning process => reflection hypothesis
- Representation is a powerful method for the construction of systems,
  reflection is a kind of behaviour we are asking our systems to exhibit.
- Interpreter is just a component of a computational process.
- Theoretical backdrop:
  1. Definition of reflection needs to be backed by a theoretical apparatus
     capable of distinguishing between interpreted and interpreting levels.
  2. ??? p21
  3. Distinguishing between reflection and representation --- it must re-present
     its mental states, not sufficient to merely represent.
  4. What is explicit vs implicit reflection?
- TODO 23-25

# Chapter 1

- p31 What is extensional portion?
- p34 what does he mean by the lack of assertional force?
- p36 what is "extensional" attention?
- p38 computational self-reference vs reflection? What is the difference
  according to him?
- Procedural reflection: shift to metalevel to modify and have modifications
  take effect.
