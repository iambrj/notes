# What Is Language?

- Language is what makes us human?
- What does it mean to "know" a language?
- Ugandan practise --- kintu ("thing") for a newborn, muntu ("person") after
    they learn language
- Sound system of a language (what sounds can occur, in what combinations can
    these sounds occur etc)
- Vocabulary
- Relationship between speech sounds and meanings they represent is arbitrary
- Linguistic system of a language
    1. Phonology: the sound system
    2. Morphology and lexicon: structure and properties of words
    3. Syntax: rules for constructing phrases and sentences
    4. Semantics: ways in which sounds and meanings are related
- Linguistic competence: knowledge of the linguistic system itself
- Linguistic performance: how well can one employ linguistic competence?
- E.g. monks taking vows of silence have no linguistic performance, yet they
    retain their linguistic competence
- Descriptive grammar: grammar attempting to *describe* the common parts of
    language used by people
- Prescriptive grammar: grammar attempting to *prescribe* how people ought to
    use language
- Pedagogical/teaching grammar: grammars for people to learn languages
- Universal Grammar(UG): blueprint for the grammars of all possible human
    languages
- Sapir-Whorf hypothesis: relates language and cognition
    1. Linguistic determinism: language *determines* individuals' cognition
    2. Linguistic relativism: language *affects* individuals' cognition

# Brain and Language

- Neurolinguistics: study of neural and biological foundations of language
- Aphasia: language damage caused by disease or trauma
- Borca's area: front part of left hemisphere where the French surgeon Paul
    Broca proposed language is localized.
- Wernicke's area: lesions in the ares of the left hemisphere temporal lobe,
    where the German neurologist Carl Wernicke proposed language is localized.
- Lateralization: localization of function to one hemisphere of the brain
- Borca's aphasia: labored speech and word-finding difficulties, affects ability
    to form sentences with rules of syntax. Agrammatic language is produced.
- Wernicke's aphasia: syntactically valid, semantically incoherent. Difficulty
    finding words, use nonsense words/gibberish.
- Neural connections exist among phonetically alike and semantically related
  words.
- Tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon.
- Amonia: inability to find the word one wishes to speak.
- Deaf speakers with brain damage show aphasia with sign language.
- Language is a separate cognitive model.
- Plasticity of the brain decreases with age --- children whose left-hemispheres
    are surgically removed develop linguistic abilities in their
    right-hemisphere (one theory suggests removing the left-hemisphere merely
    unlocks the latent potential for language in the right-hemisphere), but
    removal in adults results in severe permanent loss of the faculty of
    language.
- However, right hemisphere is also involved in language acquisition ---
    children whose right hemispheres are removed do not develop language.
