# Clean Code

- LeBlanc's law: Later equals never.
- What if you are the doctor and the patient demands that you stop all the
    silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it is taking too much
    time?
- Just because we can recognize a good painting from a bad one does not mean we
    know how to paint a good painting (painting = writing code).
- Bad code tempts the mess to grow --- when others change bad code, they make it
    worse.
- If it hath not tests, it be unclean.
- Clean code is that which is left by someone who cares deeply about the craft.
- Each method/class should do *one* thing *well*.
- ***No*** duplication.
- Ward Cunningham:
> You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to
> be pretty much what you expected. You can call it beautiful code when the code
> also makes it look like the language was made for the problem.
- The designer makes it look ridiculously simple like all exceptional designs.
- Making it easier to read actually makes it easier to write.
- Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
