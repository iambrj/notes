# Lecture 1 : 17/08/2021

- Model exploits math to represent, analyze or make predictions about real world
    phenomenon.
- Models as "replica" of real-life systems.
- Mathematical models as differential equations.
- Why need modelling?
    1. Infeasible experiments.
    2. Complicated results that are difficult to comprehend.
- Uses of models
    * Gives physical explanation of a phenomenon.
    * Helps make predictions.
    * Helps build hypothesis.
- Biological processes are not static.
- Dynamical systems: systems changing with times. Examples:
    1. COVID modelling.
    2. Number of predators and preys in ecosystem.
    3. Infections disease modelling.
    4. Gene expansion (transcription, translation).
    5. Signal transduction.
    6. Growth of bacteria in a fermenter.
    7. Sleep cycle.

## Differential equations
- Order of a differential equation = order of highest derivative.
- Degree of a differential equation = power of highest derivative.
- Linear differential equation:
$$
a_0(x)y^{(n)} + a_1(x)y^{(n - 1)} + \dots + a_n(x)y = F(x)
$$

where $a_i(x)$ and $F(x)$ are single variable functions of $x$.

## Population models
- Malthusian model: the rate of growth of population is directly proportional to
    the population at that moment.
- Modify Malthusian model to incorporate more complex features.
- Carrying capacity: limit of a population as time tends to infinity.
