# Chapter 2: Moral Reasoning
- 

# Chapter 6: Kantian Ethics
- Principle of universalizability: An act is morally acceptable if, and only if,
    its maxim is universalizable.
    1. Maxim: the principle of action one gives oneself when one is about to do
       something (what are you about to do + why are you doing it).
    2. Universalizability:
        1. Formulate maxim clearly: what you intend to do and why you inted to
           do it.
        2. Imagine a world in which everyone supports and acts on your maxim.
        3. Ask: Can the goal of my action be achieved in such a world?
    If answer to 3 is yes, then maxim is moral, no then immoral.

# Chapter 23: Sexual Morality
- Polyamorous marriage has often been prohibited because of the prevalence of
    oppressive and exploitative polygamous relationships (esp towards women via
    polygamy).
- Liberal argument: Sex is morally permissible if and only if it is engaged in
  by consenting adults.
